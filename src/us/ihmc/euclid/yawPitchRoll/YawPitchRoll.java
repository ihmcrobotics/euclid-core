/**
 * A yaw-pitch-roll is used to represent a 3D orientation by three successive rotations: rotation
 * around the z-axis (yaw), then around the y-axis (pitch), and then around the x-axis (roll). The
 * three components yaw, pitch, and roll represents the angle for rotation expressed in radians.
 * <p>
 * In general, yaw-pitch-roll representation is considered one of the most intuitive way of
 * interpreting an orientation and is thus commonly used as an interface between human and machine.
 * However, there is no algebra directly accessible for manipulating orientations represented as
 * yaw-pitch-roll making it highly computationally expensive when compared to rotation matrices or
 * quaternions. In addition, yaw-pitch-roll representation is sensitive to gimbal lock which happens
 * when the pitch angle is in the neighborhood of either <i>pi</i> or -<i>pi</i>. When close to such
 * configuration, converting orientation to yaw-pitch-roll becomes inaccurate and can sometimes lead
 * to unexpected results.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Equivalent representation of yaw-pitch-roll as 3-by-3 rotation matrix:
 * 
 * <pre>
 *     / cos(yaw) -sin(yaw) 0 \   /  cos(pitch) 0 sin(pitch) \   / 1     0          0     \
 * R = | sin(yaw)  cos(yaw) 0 | * |      0      1     0      | * | 0 cos(roll) -sin(roll) |
 *     \    0         0     1 /   \ -sin(pitch) 0 cos(pitch) /   \ 0 sin(roll)  cos(roll) /
 * </pre>
 * </p>
