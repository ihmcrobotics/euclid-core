/**
 * Read-only interface for a 4 dimensional vector representing a generic quaternion.
 * <p>
 * When describing a 4D tuple, its 4 components are often gathered in two groups: the scalar part
 * {@code s} and the vector part ({@code x}, {@code y}, {@code z}).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note on the difference between applying a 3D transform on a quaternion and a 4D vector:
 * <ul>
 * <li>When transformed by a homogeneous transformation matrix, a quaternion is only pre-multiplied
 * by the rotation part of the transform, resulting in concatenating the orientations of the
 * transform and the quaternion.
 * <li>When transformed by a homogeneous transformation matrix, a 4D vector scalar part {@code s}
 * remains unchanged. The vector part ({@code x}, {@code y}, {@code z}) is scaled and rotated, and
 * translated by {@code s} times the translation part of the transform. Note that for {@code s = 0},
 * a 4D vector behaves as a 3D vector, and for {@code s = 1} it behaves as a 3D point.
 * </ul>
 * </p>

 * @param <T> The final type of the vector used.
