/**
 * Read-only interface for a 3 dimensional point.
 * <p>
 * A 3D point represents the 3D coordinates of a location in space.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Although a point and vector hold onto the same type of information, the distinction is made
 * between them as they represent different geometry objects and are typically not handled the same
 * way:
 * <ul>
 * <li>a point represents the coordinate of a location in space. A notable difference with a vector
 * is that the distance between two points has a physical meaning. When a point is transformed with
 * a homogeneous transformation matrix, a point's coordinates are susceptible to be scaled, rotated,
 * and translated.
 * <li>a vector is not constrained to a location in space. Instead, a vector represents some
 * physical quantity that has a direction and a magnitude such as: a velocity, a force, the
 * translation from one point to another, etc. When a vector is transformed with a homogeneous
 * transformation matrix, its components are susceptible to be scaled and rotated, but never to be
 * translated.
 * </ul>
 * </p>
